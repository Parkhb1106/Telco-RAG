Another central role of RRC within each communicating party (i.e, within UE and Network) is to work as a control center for all of the lower layers within each system. The collection of all the lower layers within UE or basestation is called 'Radio Resource' (i.e, resources required to make radio communication possible)....\nThis retrieval is performed from the document 3GPP data\/web\/output_cleaned\/www_sharetechnote_com_html_5G_5G_RRC_Overview_html_b5941853_cleaned.txt.\n\n\nRetrieval 2:\n...5G\/NR - RRC Overview RRC State Overview RRC stands for Radio Resource Control.

In this page, I will give you the brief introduction to RRC in NR. In fact, RRC is a huge topic because it eventually get involved in whole protocol stack.
