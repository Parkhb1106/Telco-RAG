In this page, I will give you the brief introduction to RRC in NR. In fact, RRC is a huge topic because it eventually get involved in whole protocol stack. So it would be difficult to describe the wholes details of RRC in single page. So I would just talk about overall RRC structure \/ functions in this page and for furth...\nThis retrieval is performed from the document 3GPP data\/web\/output_cleaned\/www_sharetechnote_com_html_5G_5G_RRC_Overview_html_b5941853_cleaned.txt.\n\n\nRetrieval 13:\n...4.1 Introduction\n\nThis specification is organised as follows:\n\nclause 4.2 describes the RRC protocol model;\n\nclause 4.3 specifies the services provided to upper layers as well as the services expected from lower layers;\n\nclause 4.4 lists the RRC functions;\n\nclause 5 specifies RRC procedures, including UE state transitions;\n\nclause 6 specifies the RRC messages in ASN.1 and description;\n\nclause 7 specifies the variables (including protocol timers and constants) and counters to be used by the UE;...\nThis retrieval is performed from the document 3GPP 38331-i80.docx.\n\n\nRetrieval 17:\n...\u2013 AS-Config\n\nThe AS-Config IE contains information about RRC configuration information in the source eNB which can be utilized by target eNB to determine the need to change the RRC configuration during the handover preparation phase.
