      "question": "5G NAS introduces new concepts absent in LTE. For example, during a 5G standalone Registration procedure, the UE can indicate desired network slices. How is network slice selection handled in the 5GS Registration, and how does this differ from the EPS Attach procedure?",
      "options": {
         "option 1": "Slices are chosen by the UE after registration, no signaling needed during Registration",
         "option 2": "The UE includes requested slice identifiers (S-NSSAIs) in the Registration Request, and the network responds with allowed or rejected slices in the Registration Accept, unlike LTE which has no slice concept in Attach",
         "option 3": "Slice selection in 5G is done by the RRC layer and is identical to LTE APN selection",
         "option 4": "The network assigns a random slice to the UE during Registration, similar to default EPS bearer assignment in LTE"
      },
      "answer": "option 2: The UE includes requested slice identifiers (S-NSSAIs) in the Registration Request, and the network responds with allowed or rejected slices in the Registration Accept, unlike LTE which has no slice concept in Attach",
      "explanation": "In 5G Standalone (5GS), the UE can request specific network slices by including S-NSSAI values in the Registration Request. The AMF will indicate which slices are allowed, partially allowed, or rejected in the Registration Accept. LTE’s EPS Attach had no concept of network slicing, so this slice negotiation is new to 5GS NAS.",

      "options": {
         "option 1": "The UE sends a Tracking Area Update message in 5G just like in LTE, with no changes",
         "option 2": "The UE performs a fresh Initial Registration from scratch every time it moves to a new area",
         "option 3": "The UE uses the Registration Request with a Registration Type indicating a Mobility or Periodic update, which serves the same purpose as a TAU in LTE",
         "option 4": "5G does not require any update when moving to a new area; the UE remains registered until it deregisters"
      },
      "answer": "option 3: The UE uses the Registration Request with a Registration Type indicating a Mobility or Periodic update, which serves the same purpose as a TAU in LTE",
      "explanation": "5GS simplifies procedures by using the Registration Request for both initial and update scenarios. When a UE needs to update its location (e.g., entering a new tracking area or periodic update), it sends a Registration Request with the Registration Type set appropriately (such as \"mobility update\" or \"periodic update\"). This consolidates the function of LTE’s Tracking Area Update into the 5G Registration procedure.",

      "answer": "option 2: 5G decouples registration from session setup: the UE may complete Registration without any PDU session, unless it requests one, whereas LTE Attach automatically set up a default bearer for data",
      "explanation": "In LTE, the Attach procedure inherently establishes a default EPS bearer for data (usually for internet APN) upon success. In 5G, by contrast, the registration (Registration Accept) does not automatically create a PDU Session unless the UE explicitly requested one during the procedure. This means a 5G UE can register with the network and only later initiate a PDU Session establishment for data, offering more flexibility.",

      "explanation": "When an LTE UE needs voice service via CS fallback (because VoLTE isn’t used), it uses a Combined EPS/IMSI Attach. In the Attach Request, the UE indicates this combined attach type. The MME then performs both the EPS attach and triggers a registration on the circuit-switched network (e.g., providing the VLR with the user’s location).

      "explanation": "In LTE, the UE is configured with a list of Tracking Areas. If it detects that it has entered an area not in the allowed list (a new TA), it triggers a \"normal\" Tracking Area Update to inform the network of its new location. Additionally, the UE has a periodic update timer; when it expires, a \"periodic\" TAU is sent to refresh the registration.

      "explanation": "EPS Emergency Attach is a procedure defined for scenarios where a UE may need to access emergency services without having normal service (for example, no SIM or barred SIM for normal use). In this procedure, the UE indicates an emergency attach type. The network, if configured to allow emergency bearer services, will accept the attach and only permit emergency calls.

      "explanation": "In LTE, the sequence of RRC connection establishment involves the UE sending RRC Connection Request, the eNodeB replying with RRC Connection Setup, and then the UE responding with RRC Connection Setup Complete. The RRC Connection Setup Complete message contains a dedicated NAS payload (e.g., the Attach Request for EPS) to kick off the NAS procedures. This piggybacking is crucial: it means that as soon as the RRC layer is up, the UE can start the attach to the EPC within the same message.",

      "explanation": "In LTE, a handover is initiated by the source eNodeB sending an RRC Connection Reconfiguration message that includes mobilityControlInformation (the details for the target cell). Upon receiving this, the UE quickly switches to the target cell’s radio parameters (frequencies, etc.), and once synchronized and connected to the target, the UE sends an RRC Connection Reconfiguration Complete to the target eNodeB.

If the network wants the UE to move to another frequency or RAT (for example, an LTE carrier on another band, or to WCDMA/GSM), it provides the target frequency and radio access technology in the release message. The UE, upon receiving the release, goes to RRC_IDLE and then uses the provided info to immediately search and reselect to the specified target, rather than randomly camping on the old frequency.",

      "question": "In 5G NR, one frame is 10 ms like in LTE, but the number of slots per frame depends on the subcarrier spacing (SCS). If an NR cell uses 60 kHz SCS, approximately how many slots are there in a 10 ms frame and how long is each slot?",

         "option 1": "There would still be 10 slots per 10 ms frame, each slot 1 ms long, regardless of SCS",
         "option 2": "At 60 kHz SCS (which is 4 times the 15 kHz base), there are 40 slots in 10 ms (4 slots per ms), so each slot is 0.25 ms long",

      "explanation": "NR’s slot duration shrinks as subcarrier spacing increases. The relationship is that doubling SCS doubles the number of slots per frame (since each slot is half the length). 15 kHz corresponds to 10 slots in 10 ms (1 ms each). 30 kHz → 20 slots (0.5 ms each). 60 kHz → 40 slots per frame, meaning each slot is 0.25 ms.

      "answer": "option 2: A standard NR slot contains 14 OFDM symbols (normal CP), just like LTE, and as SCS increases (spacing wider), the slot duration becomes shorter in time",
      "explanation": "For normal cyclic prefix, an NR slot always has 14 OFDM symbols, mirroring LTE’s basic structure. However, unlike LTE (where the subcarrier spacing was fixed at 15 kHz), NR can use various SCS values. When SCS increases, each OFDM symbol (and thus the whole slot of 14 symbols) occupies less time.

      "explanation": "NR permits transmissions that don’t occupy a full slot duration, known as mini-slots (e.g., 2, 4, or 7 symbols). These can be scheduled asynchronously relative to the regular slot timing. This flexibility means, for example, an URLLC packet can be sent as soon as resources are available, without having to align strictly to a 1 ms boundary as in LTE.

      "explanation": "During handover (or other scenarios like on request by network), the network can provide the UE with a specific RACH preamble to use. In this case, the UE’s random access is contention-free (also called dedicated RA) because only that UE will use the assigned preamble. This avoids collisions and speeds up access, which is critical during time-sensitive handovers.

The 2-step RA condenses this: the UE sends a PRACH preamble *with* an uplink payload piggybacked (MsgA), and the gNB’s response (MsgB) includes both the grant and the contention resolution.

      "explanation": "NR has minimized always-on broadcasts to reduce overhead. Typically, only the MIB (with essential radio info) and SIB1 (with cell access parameters and scheduling info) are broadcast periodically. Additional system information (like SIB2, SIB3, etc., which might include neighboring cell info, etc.) is not broadcast all the time. Instead, if a UE requires it (for example, to evaluate cell reselection criteria or specific services), the UE will establish an RRC connection (if not already in one) and request the information via an RRC SystemInformationRequest message. The gNB then delivers the needed SIBs in a dedicated SystemInformation message. This contrasts with LTE, where many SIBs were periodically broadcast to all UEs.",

In LTE, the MIB contained the DL bandwidth indication and PHICH configuration (related to uplink HARQ), which aren’t needed in NR.

The UE continuously monitors the quality of the reference signals on the serving beam (this could be SSB or a dedicated CSI-RS designated for beam tracking). If a configured number of consecutive signals are missed (indicating the beam is lost), the UE declares a beam failure. It then searches for a viable new beam (from other SSBs/CSI-RS it was measuring). To switch to the new beam, the UE quickly triggers a beam recovery random access, using a dedicated preamble and a special RNTI that flags it as a beam recovery attempt. The gNB, upon receiving this, can adjust the connection to the new beam without the UE dropping the call.

SRS are uplink reference signals that the UE can transmit periodically or upon request, potentially sweeping through its transmit antenna beams if it has multiple. The gNB listens to these SRS bursts and evaluates the signal quality from each UE on different spatial directions. Using that info, the gNB can infer which uplink beam from the UE is strongest and can either adjust its reception beamforming or instruct the UE to use a particular transmit beam if the UE supports switching.

The network knows the UE is in Inactive in a certain area (RNA, RAN Notification Area). When data needs to be sent or received, the UE can resume its RRC connection via a lightweight procedure instead of the heavier idle-to-connected transition.

If it leaves the RNA, it performs an RNA update (resuming briefly or signaling to update its area) to let the network know its new area.

It may also implicitly tie the UE to an RNA for paging. By doing this, the UE releases the dedicated resources but holds on to the provided ID.

The gNB can have CORESETs at different positions (for common or UE-specific controls, etc.). This means, for example, NR can place control info at different times or frequency locations, optimizing for different scenarios (like beamforming or TDD patterns).

It remains on the current serving cell until the trigger condition occurs. At that point, without waiting for a new command from the source, the UE can initiate the handover to the target using the pre-provided configuration.

On the downlink, when the gNB sends data (PDSCH) to a particular UE, it multiplexes DMRS symbols within that PDSCH burst.

Similarly, for uplink, the UE includes DMRS in its PUSCH (carrying its uplink data), so the gNB can do the channel estimation for that UE’s signal. DMRS are not broadcast to everyone; they’re tied to the specific transmission (often generated with UE-specific identifiers), distinguishing them from common reference signals like CSI-RS or the old LTE CRS.

Essentially, SRS gives the network insight into the uplink channel quality without needing a data transmission to measure.

The gNB can configure PTRS to be present on certain symbols within a PDSCH/PUSCH transmission. The PTRS sequences are known to the receiver and are placed in such a way that the receiver can track the phase error over time. By comparing the received PTRS phase to the expected phase, the UE or gNB can estimate any phase rotation that occurred and correct the constellation accordingly.

On the downlink, CSI-RS (Channel State Information RS) can be configured as beamforming reference signals – the gNB may sweep CSI-RS across different beams or panels. The UE measures their quality and reports e.g., the preferred beam or a CSI report (like PMI, RI) indicating how to tweak the beam. This helps the gNB pick the best downlink beam for the UE. On the uplink, the UE’s SRS (Sounding RS) plays a similar role: the UE might send SRS using different transmit beams (if it has that capability), and the gNB measures to choose the best uplink beam or to adjust its receiver.

Essentially, if the UE can’t reliably demodulate the reference signals that keep the link aligned, it suspects the beam is lost. On detecting this, the UE doesn’t immediately drop the call; instead, it looks for a candidate beam (using other beams’ SSB or CSI-RS that it was possibly tracking in the background). When it finds a suitable alternative beam, it initiates the beam failure recovery procedure by sending a preamble on that new beam.

This report is usually sent on an uplink control channel (often via PUCCH if it’s a short report). The network then knows which beam is optimal according to the UE’s perspective. Using that info, the gNB can then switch its downlink transmission to that beam or adjust its beamforming accordingly, which is the final decision/application phase (P4).

The UE is given search space configurations via RRC. For example, a common search space might be configured in CORESET0 for SIB1 or paging, whereas a UE-specific search space might be configured in another CORESET for that UE’s scheduled data grants.

Additionally, if the control information to send is minimal (say, not many UEs to schedule in a given slot), NR can confine PDCCH to maybe just 1 symbol or a narrow bandwidth CORESET, leaving more symbols or frequencies for data or even allowing early switching to uplink in that slot.
